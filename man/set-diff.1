.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
List the lines which are in the first file and not in the second.
.PP
The lines are output in a sorted order and not necessarily the order of
the first file.
.PP
If the files are already sorted, it is faster to use
\f[C]comm\ \-23\f[].
.PP
\f[C]comm\ \-23\f[] gives erroneous results with no warning if the input
files are not sorted.
